# Changelog

## Upgrading to 1.0

- because of the merge of django-leaflet-storage inside umap, the migrations
  has been reset, so a bit of SQL needs to be ran by hand:

```sql
BEGIN;
DELETE FROM django_migrations WHERE app = 'leaflet_storage';
DELETE FROM django_migrations WHERE app = 'umap';
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_datalayer RENAME TO umap_datalayer;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_datalayer_id_seq RENAME TO umap_datalayer_id_seq;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_licence RENAME TO umap_licence;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_licence_id_seq RENAME TO umap_licence_id_seq;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_map RENAME TO umap_map;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_map_editors RENAME TO umap_map_editors;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_map_editors_id_seq RENAME TO umap_map_editors_id_seq;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_map_id_seq RENAME TO umap_map_id_seq;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_pictogram RENAME TO umap_pictogram;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_pictogram_id_seq RENAME TO umap_pictogram_id_seq;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_tilelayer RENAME TO umap_tilelayer;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_tilelayer_id_seq RENAME TO umap_tilelayer_id_seq;
COMMIT;
```

- Then fake initial migrations:

        umap migrate --fake-initial

- Then run the new migrations:

        umap migrate

- If you have customized some templates, change any `leaflet_storage/` path
  to `umap/`

- If you have customized some static, change any `storage/` path
  to `umap/`

- Each `LEAFLET_STORAGE_XXX` setting should be renamed in `UMAP_XXX` (but we
  still support them for now)
