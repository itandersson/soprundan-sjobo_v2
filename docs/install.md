# Installation

## System dependencies

uMap is built with the [Python](https://python.org) language, and the [Django](https://djangoproject.com) framework. It needs a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, with the [Postgis](https://postgis.net/) extension enabled.

Here are the commands to install the required system dependencies.

=== "Debian"
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3 python3-dev python3-venv virtualenv postgresql gcc postgis libpq-dev
    ``` 

=== "Arch Linux"
    ```bash
    yay postgis extra/postgresql-libs
    ```

=== "OS X (with brew)"

    ```bash
    brew install postgis
    ```

=== "Fedora"

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install postgis libpq-devel make gcc python3-devel
    ```

### PostgreSQL

Depending on your system, you might need to create a postgres user, the database, and initialize postgres. Here's how:

```bash
createuser umap -U postgres
createdb umap -O umap -U postgres
psql umap -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis" -Upostgres
```

## Getting started

Create a geo aware database. See the [GeoDjango docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/install/) for backend installation.

### Creating a virtual environment 

It is recommended to install python projects in a virtual environment to avoid mixing the project installation with your system dependencies. But it's not a requirement and it is up to you ðŸ«£

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing the dependencies

You can get all the project dependencies installed with the following command:

```bash
pip install umap-project
```

### Configuration

Create a default `local_settings.py` file, that you will modify with your setting.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umap-project/umap/master/umap/settings/local.py.sample -O local_settings.py
```

Reference it as env var:

```bash
export UMAP_SETTINGS=`pwd`/local_settings.py
```

Add database connection information in `local_settings.py`, for example

```python title="local_settings.py"
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
        'NAME': 'umap',
    }
}
```

Depending on your installation, you might need to change the user that connects the database.

It should look like this:

```python title="local_settings.py"
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis",
        "NAME": "umap",
        "USER": "postgres",
    }
}
```

Add a `SECRET_KEY` in `local_settings.py` with a long random secret key

```title="local_settings.py"
SECRET_KEY = "a long and random secret key that must not be shared"
```

You can easily generate one with [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/):

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

uMap uses [python-social-auth](http://python-social-auth.readthedocs.org/) for user authentication. So you will need to configure it according to your needs. For example

```title="local_settings.py"
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'social_auth.backends.contrib.github.GithubBackend',
    'social_auth.backends.contrib.bitbucket.BitbucketBackend',
    'social_auth.backends.twitter.TwitterBackend',
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
)
GITHUB_APP_ID = 'xxx'
GITHUB_API_SECRET = 'zzz'
BITBUCKET_CONSUMER_KEY = 'xxx'
BITBUCKET_CONSUMER_SECRET = 'zzz'
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY = "xxx"
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET = "yyy"
```

Adapt the `STATIC_ROOT` and `MEDIA_ROOT` to your local environment.

## Bootstrapping the database

Here are the commands you'll need to run to create the tables, collect the static files, etc.

```bash
# Create the database tables
umap migrate

# Collect and compress static files
umap collectstatic
umap compress

# Create a super user
umap createsuperuser

# Finally start the server
umap runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## Configuring emails

UMap can send the anonymous edit link by email. For this to work, you need to
add email specific settings. See [the related settings](config/settings.md#email_backend) for more info.

## Upgrading your installation

Usually, for upgrading, you need those steps:

```bash
pip install umap-project --upgrade
umap migrate
umap collectstatic
umap compress
```
